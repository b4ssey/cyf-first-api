This is the 1st API for the task of week 2. It is a simple nodeJS app.

## Instructions

1. Fork this repo.
2. edit variables in index.js i.e. YOUR_NAME and YOUR_LUCKY_NUMBER.
3. Commit your changes.
4. Proceed to deploy on AWS ec2 instance.

### Notes on the project

- This project has no security measures and has the tendency to break in the future.
- If that happens (breaks), delete the node modules and run 'npm install' command in cyf-first-api directory.
- Do not worry about the localhost, for now, change it when you have successfully deployed.
- Do not save keys plainly in your forked repo, talking from experience.

I am open to questions and pull requests. Happy hacking. Cheers.
